"prabhākara-guroḥ pakṣaḥ saṅkṣepād atha kathyate | 
tuṣṭāva pūrva-mīmāṁsām ācārya-spardhayāpi yaḥ ||1||","प्रभाकर-गुरोः पक्षः सङ्क्षेपाद् अथ कथ्यते । 
तुष्टाव पूर्व-मीमांसाम् आचार्य-स्पर्धयापि यः ||१||","1. Now, the theory of the teacher Prabhakara, who, even out of rivalry with his (own) preceptor, extolled the Purva-mimamsa, will be briefly described."
"dravyaṃ guṇāstathā karma sāmānyaṃ paratantratā | 
pañcārthāśakti sādṛśya sagvṅayābhistvaṣṭadhā smṛtāḥ ||2||

न विशेषो न चाभावो भूतलाग्य तिरेकतः । 
वेदैक-विहितं कर्म मोक्षदं नापरं गुरोः ||३||","2-3. According to (this) teacher, there are five categories, namely, substance, quality, action, generality and subordination -­ which, along with power, similarity and number, are understood to be (altogether) of eight different kinds : there is no particularity, and there is no non-existence as apart from the (correlated) surface of the earth, etc. : and only that work which is ordained in the Vedas can be the bestower of the salvation of soul-emancipation, and no other (work is capable of being the bestower of such salvation)."

यथावद् आत्मनां तत्र बोधं विदधते स्फुटम् । 
बुद्धीन्द्रिय-शरीरेभ्यो भिन्न आत्मा विभुर् ध्रुवः ||६||","4-6. Indeed, he becomes subject to bondage, who performs such karmas as have desirable (selfish) objects in view, or such (karmas) as are prohibited (in the scriptures). The (contents of the) Vedas are divisible into four kinds, as vidhis (or mandatory injunctions), arthavadas (or explanatory disquisitions), mantras (or metrical hymns), and namadheyas (or names). These (Vedas) have the mandatory injunctions as their important subject-matter, and teach us what constitute (our) duties as well as what do not constitute (our) duties. Such injunctions -- as ""The atman (or self) has to be known"" -- are contained in the Aruna (that is, in the Upanishads), and clearly enjoin there (the acquisition of) the knowledge of the self as it really is. The atman (or self) is different from the intellect, the senses, and the body, and is all -­ pervading and unchanging."
"nānā-bhūtaḥ pratikṣeptram artha-jñāneṣu bhāsate | 
ghaṭaṁ jānāmy ahaṁ spaṣṭam ity atra yugapat trayam ||7||","नाना-भूतः प्रतिक्षेप्त्रम् अर्थ-ज्ञानेषु भासते । 
घटं जानाम्य् अहं स्पष्टम् इत्य् अत्र युगपत् त्रयम् ||७||","7. In the cognition of objects, it appears to be varied in form in relation to every one of the (many) fields (of objective cognition). In (the perception) -- ""I know the pot well"" -- surely there arises to a person at once a threefold cognition."
"ghaṭo viṣaya-rūpeṇa kartāhaṁ-pratyayāgataḥ | 
svayaṁ-prakāśa-rūpeṇa jñānaṁ bhāti janasya hi ||8||","घटो विषय-रूपेण कर्ताहं-प्रत्ययागतः । 
स्वयं-प्रकाश-रूपेण ज्ञानं भाति जनस्य हि ||८||","8. Indeed, to the (perceiving) person, the pot appears as constituting the object of knowledge, the agential subject of knowledge (appears) as derived from the ego-idea, and the knowledge (itself appears) as a self-luminous something."
"karaṇoparamān muktim āha vaiśeṣiko yathā |

प्रयत्न-सुख-दुःखेच्छा-धर्माधर्मादि-नाशतः । 
पाषाणवद् अवस्थानम् आत्मनो मुक्तिम् इच्छति ||१०||","9-10. The Vaisesika has declared that the final deliverance of the soul results from the cessation of the activities of the instruments (of the soul). Accordingly, he, being anxious to cross the shoreless ocean of unendurable samsara, wishes to attain that (final) deliverance of the soul, which is (merely) a state of existence similar to that of a stone, and is the outcome of the destruction of volitional effort, pleasure, pain, desire, merit, demerit, etc."
"duḥkha-sādhya-sukhocchedo duḥkhocchedavad iṣyate | 
nityānandānubhūtiś ca nirguṇasya na ceṣyate ||11||","दुःख-साध्य-सुखोच्छेदो दुःखोच्छेदवद् इष्यते । 
नित्यानन्दानुभूतिश् च निर्गुणस्य न चेष्यते ||११||","11. The destruction of pleasure, which is (itself) achieved with pain, is as desirable as the destruction of pain (itself). The experience of eternal bliss cannot, moreover, be admitted in relation to the attributeless (soul)."
"na buddhi-bhedaṁ janayed ajñānāṁ karma-saṅginām | 
anyaḥ sannyāsināṁ mārgo jāghaṭīti na karmiṇām ||12||","न बुद्धि-भेदं जनयेद् अज्ञानां कर्म-सङ्गिनाम् । 
अन्यः सन्न्यासिनां मार्गो जाघटीति न कर्मिणाम् ||१२||",12. One should not create a change of view in (the minds of) those ignorant persons who are attached to karma (or ritualistic work). The path to be adopted by those who have renounced the world is different; (and that) is not at all suited to those who are devoted to (ritualistic) work.
"tasmāt yāgādayo dharmāḥ kartavyā vihitā yataḥ | 
anyathā pratyavāyaḥ syāt karmaṇy evādhikāriṇām ||13||","तस्मात् यागादयो धर्माः कर्तव्या विहिता यतः । 
अन्यथा प्रत्यवायः स्यात् कर्मण्य् एवाधिकारिणाम् ||१३||","13. Therefore, considering that they are enjoined (in the scripture), sacrifices and other religious duties have (all) to be performed. Otherwise, the harm of sinfulness will befall those who are qualified only to live the life of (ritualistic) works."
"karma-mātraika-śaraṇāḥ śreyaḥ prāpsyanty anuttamam | 
na devatā caturthy-anta-viniyogād ṛte parā ||14||","कर्म-मात्रैक-शरणाः श्रेयः प्राप्स्यन्त्य् अनुत्तमम् । 
न देवता चतुर्थ्य्-अन्त-विनियोगाद् ऋते परा ||१४||","14. Those, who solely depend upon (such) works alone, will (also) attain unsurpassable good (in the end). There is (in fact) no superior deity other than what is aimed at by the use of the ending of the fourth (or dative) case."
"veda-bāhyān nirākṛtya bhaṭṭ.eṇair gate pathi | 
cakre prabhākaraḥ śāstraṁ guruḥ karmādhikāriṇām ||15||","वेद-बाह्यान् निराकृत्य भट्ट्।एणैर् गते पथि । 
चक्रे प्रभाकरः शास्त्रं गुरुः कर्माधिकारिणाम् ||१५||","15. On the lines laid down by his preceptor, Bhatta (Kumarila), this teacher Prabhakara set at naught (all) those who (then) stood outside the pale of the Vedas, and promulgated (his) authoritative teaching in relation to those who are qualified (merely) for (the life of ritualistic) works."
