"vijñāna-mātram atroktaṁ yogācāreṇa dhīmatā | 
jñānaṁ jñeyaṁ vinā nāsti bāhyārtho’py asti tena naḥ ||1||","विज्ञान-मात्रम् अत्रॊक्तं यॊगाचारॆण धीमता । 
ज्ञानं ज्ञॆयं विना नास्ति बाह्यार्थॊऽप्य् अस्ति तॆन नः ||१||","1. Consciousness alone has here (in this system) been postulated by the clever Yogacara. There can be no perception without an object of perception. Therefore, according to us, external objects also exist (in reality)."
"nīla-pītādibhiś citrair buddhy-ākārair ihāntaraiḥ | 
sautrāntika-mate nityaṁ bāhyārthas tv anumīyate ||2||","नील-पीतादिभिश् चित्रैर् बुद्ध्य्-आकारैर् इहान्तरैः । 
सौत्रान्तिक-मतॆ नित्यं बाह्यार्थस् त्व् अनुमीयतॆ ||२||","2. According to the view of the Sautrantikas, external objects are always inferred (to exist) by means of those differences (in perception) which consist of (many) wonderful varieties in forms of consciousness, such as blue, yellow, and so on."
"kṣīṇāni cakṣur-ādīni rūpādiṣv eva pañcasu | 
na ṣaṣṭham indriyaṁ tasya grāhakaṁ vidyate bahiḥ ||3||","क्षीणानि चक्षुर्-आदीनि रूपादिष्व् ऎव पञ्चसु । 
न षष्ठम् इन्द्रियं तस्य ग्राहकं विद्यतॆ बहिः ||३||","3. The eye and the other (organs of sense) finally lose themselves in (apprehending) the five things, such as colour, etc. To him (the Sautrantika), there is no sixth sense that apprehends what is external."
"ṣaḍ-aṁśatvaṁ tvayāpādya paramāṇor nirākṛtiḥ | 
yuktas tenāpi bāhyārtho na ced jñānaṁ na sambhavet ||4||","षड्-अंशत्वं त्वयापाद्य परमाणॊर् निराक्ड़्तिः । 
युक्तस् तॆनापि बाह्यार्थॊ न चॆद् ज्ञानं न सम्भवॆत् ||४||","4. It is (surely) appropriate (enough) that you (first) postulate (the ultimate atom) to consist of six parts (or aspects), and then (give out) a refutation of the (atomic character of the) atom. Even according to that same (process of reasoning), if there be no external object, (then) there can be no perceptive knowledge (of objects)."
"ākāśa-dhātur asmābhiḥ paramāṇur itīritaḥ | 
sa ca prajñāpti-mātraṁ syān na ca vastv-antaraṁ matam ||5||","आकाश-धातुर् अस्माभिः परमाणुर् इतीरितः । 
स च प्रज्ञाप्ति-मात्रं स्यान् न च वस्त्व्-अन्तरं मतम् ||५||","5. The element (known as) akasa is declared by us (the Sautrantika) to be (the same as) the ultimate atom. It has to be merely a notion, and is not considered to be anything else."
"sarve padārthāḥ kṣaṇikā buddhy-ākāra-vijṛmbhitā | 
idam ity eva bhāvās te’py ākārānumitāḥ sadā ||6||","सर्वॆ पदार्थाः क्षणिका बुद्ध्य्-आकार-विज्ड़्म्भिता । 
इदम् इत्य् ऎव भावास् तॆऽप्य् आकारानुमिताः सदा ||६||","6. All things are momentary (in point of existence), and are the result of the (varied) display of the forms of consciousness. Even those entities, which are (capable of being described definitely as) such and such, -- (even they) are always inferred from the  forms (of consciousness)."
"viṣayatva-virodhas tu kṣaṇikatve’pi nāsti naḥ | 
viṣayatvaṁ hi hetutvaṁ jñānākārārpaṇa-kṣamam ||7||","विषयत्व-विरॊधस् तु क्षणिकत्वॆऽपि नास्ति नः । 
विषयत्वं हि हॆतुत्वं ज्ञानाकारार्पण-क्षमम् ||७||","7. In our view, even though there is momentariness (in relation to things perceived), there is certainly (in consequence) no contradiction in (the fact of) there being objects of perception; for, to be an (external) object (of perception) is to possess the character of such a cause, as is capable of bestowing a form upon consciousness."
