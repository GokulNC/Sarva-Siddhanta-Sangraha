गृह्यते साङ्ख्य-पक्षाद् धि वेद-सारोऽथ वैदिकैः ||१||","1. Now, the essence of the Vedas, which has been given out by Vyasa in the Maha-bharata so as to be in agreement with all the Sastras, is in fact derived from the system of the Sankhyas by the believers in the Vedas."

प्रकृतिर् गुण-साम्यं स्याद् गुणाः सत्त्वं रजस् तमः ||३||","3. (These) rudimentary principles are (indeed) the elements in their subtle condition, and they are mostly held to be characterised by the three 'qualities' (of sattva, rajas, and tamas ).

गुण-स्वभावैर् आत्मा स्याद् उत्तमो मध्यमोऽधमः ||४||","4. A man's bondage (in matter) is (his) happening to be swayed by the 'qualities', and his emancipation (from that bondage) is to know how to discriminate between (these) 'qualities'. According to the nature of the 'qualities' (which sway it), an atman (or soul) is of the best, or of the middling, or of the worst kind."

The best (atman) is (that of) one who is endowed with the quality of sattva, and has a phlegmatic temperament and is of the nature of (the element of) water. The middling (variety of) atman is in fact he who is endowed with the quality of rajas ; and he is known to be of a  bilious temperament. The worst (atman), who is endowed with the quality of tamas, is of a rheumatic (or windy) temperament, for tamas is wind (looked upon as a humour of the body). The quality of sattva is (conceived to be) white (in colour), the quality of rajas (to be) red, and the quality of tamas (to be) grey (or) black."

I shall now describe tho characteristics of the five elements, which (characteristics) do not differ very much from the three qualities (of sattva, rajas and tamas). In the body of all moveable beings, (there are) five kinds of constituent materials, which are different from one another : and it is by means of them that the body puts forth (its) activities. The skin, the flesh and the bones, the marrow and the tendon as the fifth -- these (materials) in the body are considered to be made up of (the element of) earth. Power and similarly anger, and the eyes and also heat are derived out of (the element of) fire; and (this) fire also causes (the things eaten) to be digested. (These are) the five igneous products which belong to embodied beings. The ear and the nose and the mouth, the heart and the abdomen as well-these five constituent parts in the body of living beings are the outcome of the element of ether (akasa). Phlegm, bile and sweat, fat and blood as well -- thus is (the element of) water found always in five forms in the body of living beings. Through the inspiratory vital air, the embodied being is made to live; through the circulatory vital air, he always grows in size and develops; the excretory vital air goes downwards, and the digestive vital air exists in the centre (or the abdomen); through the upward expiratory vital air, he (the embodied being) breathes out and gives utterance to the various kinds of significant words."

The following seven notes (of the gamut) are the qualities obtained out of sound: (and they are) - the sadja, the rsabha and the gandhara, the madhyama, and similarly the panchama, the dhaivata, and also the misadha. The qualities produced out of (the element of) air are the following twelve in detail: (and they are) -- the hot, the cold, the pleasurable, the painful, the smooth, anc also the clean, the hard, the sticky, the fine, the thick, the soft and the rough."

Along with these qualities that are (derived out of the element) of air, they mention that sound is derived out (of the element) of ether (akasa). With the aid of those (above-mentioned) five constituent materials (of the body), one lives (well) in possession of consciousness, if they are not disorganised; if they become disorganised, one loses consciousness; (and it is through them that) one always attains growth and development.

In consequence of their own works, which follow the courses of (the qualities of) rajas, sattva and tamas, (the various beings) happen to be of the nature of those (qualities) : and (it is) the one  is only Visnu (who) attained by the gods, by the datiyas and by the raksasas (equally)."

Through the influence of the qualities of rajas, sattva and tamas, the one Visnu Himself, under the names of Brahma, Visnu and Siva, performs (in relation to the world) the (threefold) work of creation, sustentation and destruction. By means of their conduct, nature, shape and colour, all the gods are made out to be endowed with (the quality of) sattva, (all) the daityas to be endowed with (the quality of) rajas, and (all) the raksasa to be endowed with (the quality of) tamas."

Just as (all our) sacrifices culminate to us in the attainment of Visnu, so also those who are endowed with (the quality of) rajas, and those who are endowed with (the quality of) tamas, have to worship through (suitable) sacrifices Brahma and Siva, who are (respectively) characterised by those qualities."

One is released (from the bondage of samasara) by means of one's own duties. The duty prescribed for another, (if adopted by those for whom it is not prescribed), brings on fear (to such persons)."
