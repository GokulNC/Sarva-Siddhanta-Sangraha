"atra mādhyamikenoktaṁ śūnyatvaṁ śūnya-vādinā |
nirālambana-vādī tu yogācāro nirasyati ||1||","अत्र माध्यमिकेनोक्तं शून्यत्वं शून्य-वादिना ।
निरालम्बन-वादी तु योगाचारो निरस्यति ||१||","1. The Yogacara, who maintains that consciousness exists quite independently (of the existence or otherwise of external objects), refutes the theory of nothingness stated thus by the nihilist Madhyamika."
"tvayokta-sarva-śūnyatve pramāṇaṁ śūnyam eva te |
ato vāde’dhikāras te na pareṇopapadyate ||2||","त्वयोक्त-सर्व-शून्यत्वे प्रमाणं शून्यम् ऐव ते ।
अतो वादेऽधिकारस् ते न परेणोपपद्यते ||२||","2. If all is mere nothingness as mentioned by you, then (your) nothing itself has to be the criterion of truth to you. Hence you cannot appropriately have any right of discussion with others (who hold something other than nothing to be such a criterion)."
"sva-pakṣa-sthāpanaṁ tadvat para-pakṣasya dūṣaṇam |
kathaṁ karoty atra bhavān viparītaṁ vaden na kim ||3||","स्व-पक्ष-स्थापनं तद्वत् पर-पक्षस्य दूषणम् ।
कथं करोत्य् अत्र भवान् विपरीतं वदेन् न किम् ||३||","3. How do you then undertake to prove your own position and to disprove similarly the adversary's position? And why do you not here (in this case) argue, (as you well may), to the contrary?"
"avibhāgo hi buddhyātmā viparyāsita-darśanaiḥ |
grāhya-grāhaka-saṁvitti-bhedavān iva lakṣyate ||4||","अविभागो हि बुद्ध्यात्मा विपर्यासित-दर्शनैः ।
ग्राह्य-ग्राहक-संवित्ति-भेदवान् इव लक्ष्यते ||४||","4. What is of the nature of consciousness is indeed indivisible; but by those, whose vision is confused, it is seen to be, as it were, differentiated into the perceived object, the perceiving subject, and (then) the perception (itself)."
"māna-meya-phalādy-uktaṁ jñāna-dṛṣṭy-anusārataḥ |
adhikāriṣu jāteṣu tattvam apy upadekṣyati ||5||","मान-मेय-फलाद्य्-उक्तं ज्ञान-द्ड़्ष्ट्य्-अनुसारतः ।
अधिकारिषु जातेषु तत्त्वम् अप्य् उपदेक्ष्यति ||५||","5. The means of knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the resulting (knowledge), &c., have (all) been, in accordance with the (current) views regarding (the nature of) knowledge, stated (to be different and separate in character). The ultimate truth also will be expounded, when (in fact) there arise qualified persons (to grasp it)."
"buddhi-svarūpam ekaṁ hi vastv asti paramārthataḥ |
pratimānasya nānātvān na caikatvaṁ vihanyate ||6||","बुद्धि-स्वरूपम् ऐकं हि वस्त्व् अस्ति परमार्थतः ।
प्रतिमानस्य नानात्वान् न चैकत्वं विहन्यते ||६||","6. Indeed, there exists in reality (only) one thing, and that is of the nature of the intelligent principle of consciousness. And (its) oneness is not destroyed in consequence of the varied character of (its) manifestations."
"parivrāṭ-kāmuka-śunām ekasyāṁ pramadā-tanau |
kuṇapaṁ kāminī bhakṣyam iti tisro vikalpanā ||7||","परिव्राट्-कामुक-शुनाम् ऐकस्यां प्रमदा-तनौ ।
कुणपं कामिनी भक्ष्यम् इति तिस्रो विकल्पना ||७||","7. In regard to one and the same body of a fine young woman, a religious ascetic, an amorous man, and a dog have (respectively) three different views, to the effect that it is a (mere) carcase, a beloved mistress, and a thing fit to feed upon."
"athāpy ekaiva sā bālā buddhi-tattvaṁ tathaiva naḥ |
tad anyad yat tu jātyādi tan-nirākriyatāṁ tvayā ||8||","अथाप्य् ऐकैव सा बाला बुद्धि-तत्त्वं तथैव नः ।
तद् अन्यद् यत् तु जात्यादि तन्-निराक्रियतां त्वया ||८||","8. If, nevertheless, that young woman (happens to be) only one, similarly is the ultimate principle of conscionsness (only one) to us. Whatever else (is postulated) other than that, such as the (configurations of) generic characteristics, etc., -- you may (freely) disprove (all) that."
"kṣaṇikā buddhir ekā tu tridhā bhrāntair vikalpitā |
svayaṁ-prakāśa-tattva-jñair mumukṣubhir upāsyate ||9||","क्षणिका बुद्धिर् ऐका तु त्रिधा भ्रान्तैर् विकल्पिता ।
स्वयं-प्रकाश-तत्त्व-ज्ञैर् मुमुक्षुभिर् उपास्यते ||९||","9. Therefore consciousness, which is (fleeting and) momentary, and is (at the same time) wrongly differentiated in three ways by deluded persons -- (that) alone is held in honour (as the one reality) by those, who have come to know (this) self-luminous principle, and are desirous of obtaining the salvation of final deliverance."
