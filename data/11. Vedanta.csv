तद्-अर्थ-प्रवणाः प्रायः सिद्धान्ताः पर-वादिनाम् ||१||",1. Now the established conclusion of the Vedantic scriptures will be briefly given out (here). The conclusions of (all) other philosophic disputants mostly tend to (prove the truth of) that conclusion.

तत् त्वम् अस्य्-आदि-वाक्यार्थो ब्रह्म जिज्ञास्यते बुधैः ||२||","2. The Brahman, who forms the import of (Upanisadic) passages, such as -- ""That thou art"", has to be enquired into by those wise persons, who, through the good results of (their) works offered up unto the Brahman, have become qualified for (attaining) the knowledge of the Brahman."

शमो दमो मुमुक्षुत्वं यस्य तस्याधिकारिता ||३||","3. He (alone) has the (required) qualifications (for the conduct of this enquiry), who possesses the power to discriminate the eternal from the non-eternal, and is free from the desire to (enjoy) the fruits (of works) here (in this world) as well as there (in the other world), and is also characterised by (internal mental) tranquillity, the restraint of the senses, and the desire to obtain the final emancipation (of the soul)."
"tat tvam asy eva nānyas tvaṁ tac-chabdārthaḥ pareśvaraḥ |

त्वं-शब्दार्थो पुरो-वर्ती तिर्यङ्-मर्त्यादिकोऽपरः ||४||","4. ""That certainly art thou ; thou art none other."" The meaning of the word That (here) is the Supreme Lord : the meaning of the word thou is (any) other (being) that may be (pointed to) before (us) -- a beast, or a man, or any other (being)."
"tādātmyam asi śabdārtho jñeyas tat-tvaṁ-padārthayoḥ |

सोऽयं पुरुष इत्य्-आदि वाक्ये तादात्म्यवन् मतः ||५||","5. The menning of the word art (here) has to be understood to be the (predication) of identity between the meaning of the word That and the meaning of the word thou. (This is) considered to be similar to the (predication) of identity (expressed) in such sentences as -- ""This is that man."""
"syān mataṁ tat tvam asy ādi-vākyaṁ siddhārtha-bodhanāt |

कथं प्रवर्तकं पुंसां विधिर् एव प्रवर्तकः ||६||","6. Let (this your) opinion be (granted to be true). (But then), seeing that the sentence -- ""That thou art"", and other such (sentences) give rise (only) to the knowledge of such things, as are (of themselves already) well made out (without any reference to any association  any action), how can such (sentences) prompt men to (live) the active life? It is only a mandatory injunction that induces activity."
"ātmā jñātavya ity-ādi-vidhibhiḥ pratipāditāḥ |

यजमानाः प्रशस्यन्ते तत्त्व-वादैर् इहारुणैः ||७||","7. Those sacrificers, who are purported to be referred to by means of  injunctive passages, such as -- ""The self has to be known"", etc., (they) are (merely) eulogised in the Arunas, which are discussions hearing upon reality."
"buddhīndriya-śarīrebhyo bhinna ātmā vibhur dhruvaḥ | 
nānā-bhūtaḥ pratikṣetram arthavittiṣu bhāsate ||8||","बुद्धीन्द्रिय-शरीरेभ्यो भिन्न आत्मा विभुर् ध्रुवः । 
नाना-भूतः प्रतिक्षेत्रम् अर्थवित्तिषु भासते ||८||","8. The self (atman) is different from the intellect, the senses and the body; it is all-pervading and unchangeable, and appears to be manifold in (our) perceptions of things (by reason of its manifesting itself separately) in every (separate) ground of (its) habitation, (that is, in every perceivable object)."
"vyarthāto brahma-jijñāsā vākyasyānya-paratvataḥ |

अत्र ब्रूमः समाधानं न लिङ् एव प्रवर्तकः ||९||","9. Consequently the enquiry into the Brahman is fruitless, inasmuch as the sentence (""That thou art"", or any other like it in the Arunas) means what is other (than a commandment). ]. To this (objection) we give the justificatory reply that the verbal form of the potential mood (lin) is not (in speech) the only means which gives rise to activity."
"iṣṭa-sādhanatā-jñānād api lokaḥ pravartate | 
putras te jāta ity ādau vidhi-rūpo na tādṛśaḥ ||10||","इष्ट-साधनता-ज्ञानाद् अपि लोकः प्रवर्तते । 
पुत्रस् ते जात इत्य् आदौ विधि-रूपो न तादृशः ||१०||","10. People are led into activity, also by knowing (a thing) to possess the characteristics of a means (suited) to accomplish desired ends. In sentences like -- ""A son has been born to you"", the form of the injunction (giving rise to gladsome action on the part of the hearing father) is not of that (potential lin) kind."
"ātmā jñātavya ity-ādi-vidhayas tv āruṇe sthitāḥ | 
bodhaṁ vidadhate brahmaṇy ajñānād bhrānta-cetasām ||11||","आत्मा ज्ञातव्य इत्य्-आदि-विधयस् त्व् आरुणे स्थिताः । 
बोधं विदधते ब्रह्मण्य् अज्ञानाद् भ्रान्त-चेतसाम् ||११||","11. The injunctions, such as ""The self has to be known"", etc., which are (all) found in the Arunas, enjoin (as duty the acquisition of) the knowledge relating to the Brahman on (all) those whose minds have been deluded by nescienee."

तद् अयुक्तं न विज्ञानं कर्मभिः केवलैर् भवेत् ||१३||","12-13. It may be so. (But it may be said that) a person, who, after giving up such works as have (selfish) objects of desire in view, and also such (other works) as are prohibited in the scriptures, performs the works which are enjoined in the scriptures, has the internal organ (of the soul) purified, and (thereby) becomes of himself the knower (of the Brahman), without requiring any language (of instruction) from a spiritual preceptor. This (view) is not right. (The true) knowledge (of philosophic reality) cannot be obtained by means of mere works."

तत् त्वम् अस्य् आदि वाक्यौघो व्याख्यातो हि पुनः पुनः ||१६||","14-16. Indeed that is declared in the Arunas to be (true) knowledge, which is born (in the pupil) through the kindly favour of the spiritual teacher (bestowed in the way of appropriate instruction). Works give by means or (their own) power an in-bent leaning to the mind : and (then) having (thus) fulfilled (their) purpose, they disappear like clouds at the end of the rainy season. In the case of him, however, whose mind is bent inwards, and who is (thus) qualified to receive the knowledge of the Brahman; the enquiry into (the nature of) the Brahman is certainly induced by means of -- ""That thou art"" -- and other such (sentences in the teaching) of the spiritual preceptor. The collection of sentences, consisting of --""That thou art"" -- and other such (sentences), has indeed been commented upon (by various  teachers) over and over again."
"gurv-anugraha-hīnasya nātmā samyak prakāśate |

आत्माविद्यानिमित्तोत्थः प्रपञ्चः पाञ्चभौतिकः ||१७||","17. The self (atman) does not manifest itself to him who is destitute of the kindly favour of the spiritual preceptor. The universe, whioh is made up of the five elements, is produced out of the cause consisting of nescience (avidya) as appertaining to the self (atman)."
"nivartate yathā tucchaṁ śarīra-bhuvanātmakam |

तथा ब्रह्म-विवर्तं तु विज्ञेयम् अखिलं जगत् ||१८||","18. The whole world has to be realized as forming an illusory manifestation of the Brahman (constituting its basis), so that (in consequence) the unreality consisting of the body and the (outer) world goes away (at once and altogether from the vision of the truth-perceiving soul)."
"vedāntoktātma-vijñāna-viparīta-matis tu yā |

आत्मन्य् अविद्या सानादिः स्थूल-सूक्ष्मात्मना स्थिता ||१९||",19. The nescienee in respect of the self (atman) is that view (of things) which is contrary to the true knowledge of the (nature of the) self as declared in the Vedanta; and that (nescience) is beginningless and exists in a gross as well as in a subtle form.
"ātmanaḥ khaṁ tato vāyur vāyor agnis tato jalam |

From the atman (self) came forth the element of ether (akasa); from this the air (came forth) ; from the air the fire (came forth) ; from this (fire} water (came forth) ; from water the earth came into existence; and from the earth arose the paddy plant and other such plants.

आत्मत्वेन भ्रमन्त्य् अत्र वादिनः कोश-पञ्चके ||२७||","21-27. From plants (came forth) food; from food came forth man with (his) five soul-sheaths. The creature, who is made up of the subtle elements, and in whom the rudimentary elemental principles have not been separated through analysis, becomes grossifled (in the course of creation) ; and beasts, men and gods constitute (only) varieties of such (created beings). On the preponderance of virtue (in one's karma), the condition of god (arises in relation to one) : through unrighteousness (in one's karma), the condition of beast (is brought about) : on these two things (virtue and unrighteousness) being equal (in one's karma), the condition of man (is produced). Thus indeed are (the creatures) of three kinds, in accordance with (their) karmas. The skin, the blood, the flesh, the fat, the bone, the marrow of bone, and the semen -- these seven constituents of the body are (all) modifications of food. Masculinity and femininity also are not self-evolved. A male is invariably born, when there is a preponderance or the (power of the) semen in the womb (of the mother) ; a female (is born) when similarly there is a preponderance of (the power of) the uterine blood; and the (neither-male-nor-female) transgender (is born), when there is an equality of those two things. The marrow of bone, the bone and the sinew (in the child) are produced out of the semen (of the male parent) ; the skin, the flesh and the blood (in the child) are produced out of the uterine blood (of the female parent). These are called the six vestures (of the body), of which (the first) three are due to the father, and (the other) three to the mother. Hunger and thirst, sorrow and delusion, old age and death, these are the six waves (of infirmity) to be found as two and two -- in life, in the mind, and in the body (respectively). (Many) philosophic controversialists mistakenly entertain the notion of the soul here in relation to the five sheaths (of the soul)."

Since the affix 'maya' is (here) used in the sense of modification, (we have) the anandamaya repeated (again and again in the context in the scripture concerned). The Lokayata indeed accepts the body, which is (merely) that (kind of) self which is annamaya (or what is made up of food)."

According to the view of those, who truly know the self, the self has to be understood to be untouched by the quality of being the agent and by (all) other (such qualities). The agentship of the self has to be inevitably accepted by those who take their stand on that section of the scriptures which deals with ritualistic works (karmakanda), as well as by those who rely upon that section which deals with deities (devatokanda) : for, otherwise, no (ritual) work can be carried out successfully (by them). In relation to the injunction -- ""The Brahmin should kindle the (sacrificial) fires here in the spring (season)"" -- who is it that is entitled to (perform) the (enjoined) work, is it the (Brahmin's) body (in itself), or (is it the body) as in association with the soul? Seeing that, as the body is non-intelligent, it is impossible for it to have the desire for the attainment of svarga (the celestial world of enjoyments), and seeing also that (the body) is subject to be destroyed, it is not possible for it to be the agent in relation to this (kind of) work. The soul does not at all possess the characteristics of Brahmin-hood and of other such class-distinctions. That (viz., the soul) is (really) apart from class-divisions, caste, estates of life, conditions of age, and (all other such distinguishing) differences. There is (moreover) nothing other than (both) the body and the soul, which is (specially) qualified (to be the agent in relation to such ritualistic works)."

In consequence of (the variation in) function, the internal organ here is of two kinds (consisting of) the intellect (buddhi) and manas (the faculty of attention). If it be held that it is the pure and simple atman (or self) which directly shines out in the idea of I-ness (or egoity ), then tell me whether, in the idea --' I am lean,' (that self is apprehended as) pure and simple or not. Just as ' lean ' and other such (attributes) are not, owing to their perceivability, considered to be the attributes of the atman (self), so also indeed pleasure and such other things, which are (all) found (to exist altogether) in the body, cannot be the attributes of the atman. According to the view of those who (truly) know the atman, the atman is (entirely) distinct from the knower, the means of knowledge, and the object of knowledge."

The prana supports (that sheath of) the self which is made up of food; the manas supports (that sheath of the self which consists of) the prana ; and the well known Supreme Self, Govinda, who is Existence-Knowledge-Bliss, supports the (sheath made up of the) manas. When the atman, by means of the external senses, experiences  (all) such objects as are turned away from itself, then there arises the waking state, which is denoted by the name of visva. When, in fact solely by means of the manas, (it) experiences dreams whose contents are obtained through the external senses, then that state of the Supreme Self, which is called taijasa, has to be understood (to have arisen). When the atman abides in the manas, which is (itself) swallowed up by the darkness of ignorance, then it (the self) is known to be in the state of dreamless sleep, which is called prajna and is indicated by (the characteristic of) ananda (bliss). Even in sleep the prana (or life) abides, so as to remove the erroneous impreesion of death (in relation to a person who is merely sleeping). Otherwise dogs would eat up the sleeping person, or (people) would cremate (him) religiously in the sacred fire. Even in (dreamless) sleep there is surely the endurance of bliss, because (a sleeping person) on waking up and remembering (his immediately past condition) speaks out on reflection thus --""I slept happily."" (This) view may be (granted). This happiness (however) cannot be what is derived out of the objects of the senses, for the reason that there are (during deep sleep) no (such) objects (perceived). Because (also) it has to be made out (through reflection), it cannot be real (happiness in itself). Therefore there is (here) the illusion of happiness in respect of (what is merely) the absence of pain. Even though the counter-correlative (thereof) is not (fully) perceived, the absence of all (things) is (capable of being) apprehended ; because, when asked again, (the man who has risen from sound sleep), speaks to another of (his own apprehension of) the absence of all (things). It is in accordance with this reasoning that the absence of the apperception of feelings is experienced."

Since it is said (that the happiness of deep sleep is experienced) by one who has risen from sleep, the sleeping person (himself) cannot constitute a witness in relation to (any) absence of apperception."

Since, in (deep) sleep, the counter-correlative of a negation is not apprehended, the character of such (an unapprehsnded) counter-correlative belongs to pain.
