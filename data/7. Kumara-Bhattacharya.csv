"bauddhādi-nāstika-dhvasta-veda-mārgaṁ purā kila |

भट्टाचार्यः कुमारांशः स्थापयामास भू-तले ||१||","1. The great teacher Bhatta, who was a particular incarnation of Kumara (the war-god), established well on earth the (religious) path of the Vedas, which had been in fact set at naught by the Bauddhas and other atheists in former times."
"tyaktvā kāmya-niṣiddhe dve vihitācaraṇān naraḥ | 
śuddhāntaḥkaraṇo jñānī paraṁ nirvāṇam ṛcchati ||2||","त्यक्त्वा काम्य-निषिद्धे द्वे विहिताचरणान् नरः । 
शुद्धान्तःकरणो ज्ञानी परं निर्वाणम् ऋच्छति ||२||","2. On giving up both those (kinds of) works, which have (either) the attainment of particular desired objects in view, or are prohibited by the scripture, the wise man, whose mind is purified, attains the highest bliss through performing such works as are ordained (in the scripture)."
"kāmya-karmāṇi kurvāṇaiḥ kāmya-karmānurūpataḥ | 
janitvaivopabhoktavyaṁ bhūyaḥ kāmya-phalaṁ naraiḥ ||3||","काम्य-कर्माणि कुर्वाणैः काम्य-कर्मानुरूपतः । 
जनित्वैवोपभोक्तव्यं भूयः काम्य-फलं नरैः ||३||","3. The results of the works, that have particular desired objects in view, have, in accordance with those (very) works having (such) specially desired objects in view, to be enjoyed only after being born again by (those) men who perform the works with specially desired objects in view."
"kṛmi-kīṭādi-rūpeṇa janitvā tu niṣiddha-kṛt | 
niṣiddha-phala-bhogau syād adho'dho narakaṁ vrajet ||4||","कृमि-कीटादि-रूपेण जनित्वा तु निषिद्ध-कृत् । 
निषिद्ध-फल-भोगौ स्याद् अधोऽधो नरकं व्रजेत् ||४||","4. But he, who performs the works prohibited by the scripture, has, after being born in the form of worms, insects, etc., to enjoy the (bitter) fruits of forbidden works, and has to go lower and lower down into hell."
"ato vicārya vijñeyau dharmādharmau vipaścitā | 
codanaika-pramāṇau tau na pratyakṣādi-gocarau ||5||","अतो विचार्य विज्ञेयौ धर्माधर्मौ विपश्चिता । 
चोदनैक-प्रमाणौ तौ न प्रत्यक्षादि-गोचरौ ||५||","5. Therefore, both duty and non-duty have to be (clearly) made out by the wise man after due enquiry. Both of them have scriptural injunction as their authoritative basis, and do not fall within the scope of perception and such other (criteria of truth)."
"vidhy-artha-vāda-mantraiś ca nāma-dheyaiś caturvidhaḥ | 
vedo vidhi-pradhāno'yaṁ dharmādharmāvabodhakaḥ ||6||","विध्य्-अर्थ-वाद-मन्त्रैश् च नाम-धेयैश् चतुर्विधः । 
वेदो विधि-प्रधानोऽयं धर्माधर्मावबोधकः ||६||","6. The Vedas contain four different kinds (of topics), namely, vidhi (or mandatory injunctions), arthavada (or explanatory disquisitions), mantra (or metrical hymns), and namadheya (or names). The Vedas have the mandatory injunctions for their chief subject­matter, and thus teach us (mainly) about duties and non-duties."
"nivartakaṁ niṣiddhād yat puṁsāṁ dharma-pravartakam | 
vākyaṁ tac-codanā vede liḍ-loṭ-tavyādi-lāñchitam ||7||","निवर्तकं निषिद्धाद् यत् पुंसां धर्म-प्रवर्तकम् । 
वाक्यं तच्-चोदना वेदे लिड्-लोट्-तव्यादि-लाञ्छितम् ||७||","7. That (kind of) sentence in the Vedas happens to be a commandment, which turns men away from what is forbidden, or makes them become engaged in the performance of prescribed duties; and it is indicated by means of the potential mood, the imperative mood, the potential passive participles and other (similar verbal forms)."
"niṣiddha-nindakaṁ yat tu vihitārtha-praśaṁsakam | 
vākyam atrārtha-vādaḥ syād vidhy-aṁśatvāt pramāṇakam ||8||","निषिद्ध-निन्दकं यत् तु विहितार्थ-प्रशंसकम् । 
वाक्यम् अत्रार्थ-वादः स्याद् विध्य्-अंशत्वात् प्रमाणकम् ||८||","8. Whatever sentence here (in the Vedas) censures forbidden things or praises such things as are enjoined -- that is an arthavada : it has the force of an authoritative means of knowledge, for the reason that it forms an auxiliary part of injunctions."
"karmāṅga-bhūtā mantrāḥ syur anuṣṭheya-prakāśakāḥ | 
yāgāder nāma-bhūtāni nāmadheyāni hi śrutau ||9||","कर्माङ्ग-भूता मन्त्राः स्युर् अनुष्ठेय-प्रकाशकाः । 
यागादेर् नाम-भूतानि नामधेयानि हि श्रुतौ ||९||","9. Mantras are those constituent elements of (ritual) works, which throw light on what has to be accomplished (through such works). Those things which happen to be the names of sacrifices, etc., in the Vidas, they are the namadheyas in fact."
"ātmā jñātavya ity-ādi-vidhayas tv āruṇeṣu ye | 
bodhaṁ vidadhate brahmaṇyātmanāṁ paramātmani ||10||","आत्मा ज्ञातव्य इत्य्-आदि-विधयस् त्व् आरुणेषु ये । 
बोधं विदधते ब्रह्मण्यात्मनां परमात्मनि ||१०||","10. The injunction -- ""The atman (or self) has to be known"" ­- and other (similar injunctions) which are given in the Arunas (or Upanisads) enjoin on individual souls the knowledge relating to the Brahman who is the Supreme Soul."
"dūṣayanty anumānābhyāṁ bauddhā vedam api sphuṭam | 
tan-mūla-labdha-dharmāder apalāpas tu sidhyati ||11||","दूषयन्त्य् अनुमानाभ्यां बौद्धा वेदम् अपि स्फुटम् । 
तन्-मूल-लब्ध-धर्मादेर् अपलापस् तु सिध्यति ||११||","11. On the strength of the two (following) logical syllogisms, the Bauddhas distinctly find fault even with the Vedas : and the denial of the duties, etc., which are derived from those (Vedas themselves) as source, follows (thence) as a matter of course."
"vedo'pramāṇaṁ vākyatvād rathyā-puruṣa-vākyavat | 
athānāpta-praṇītatvād unmattānāṁ yathā vacaḥ ||12||","वेदोऽप्रमाणं वाक्यत्वाद् रथ्या-पुरुष-वाक्यवत् । 
अथानाप्त-प्रणीतत्वाद् उन्मत्तानां यथा वचः ||१२||","12. (Firstly), the Vedas are no authoritative means of knowledge, because they possess the characteristics of spoken sentences, (even) like the sentences of the man in the street. Again (they are not authoritative) because they are the productions of unwise and untrustworthy persons, like the speech of the insane."
"tad ayuktam imau hetū bhavetām aprayojakau | 
vākyatva-mātrād vedasya na bhavaty apramāṇatā ||13||","तद् अयुक्तम् इमौ हेतू भवेताम् अप्रयोजकौ । 
वाक्यत्व-मात्राद् वेदस्य न भवत्य् अप्रमाणता ||१३||","13. This (argument) is not right: the two reasons given above are quite ineffective (here). Simply because they (the Vedas) happen to be (made up of) sentences, it does not follow that the Vedas have not the character of an authoritative means of knowledge."
"anāpta-puruṣoktatvaṁ hetus te na prayojakaḥ | 
syād anāptoktatā-mātrād aprāmāṇyaṁ na ca śruteḥ ||14||","अनाप्त-पुरुषोक्तत्वं हेतुस् ते न प्रयोजकः । 
स्याद् अनाप्तोक्तता-मात्राद् अप्रामाण्यं न च श्रुतेः ||१४||","14. The (other) reason given by you, to the effect that they are composed by unwise and untrustworthy persons, is (also) useless (here). Want of authoritativeness (in relation to ordinary utterances) may well result from the mere fact of (their) having been uttered by an unwise and untrustworthy person. But it cannot be so in the case of revealed scriptures."
"nitya-vedasya cānāpta-praṇītatvaṁ na duṣyati | 
vipralambhādayo doṣā vidyante puṁ-girāṁ sadā ||15||","नित्य-वेदस्य चानाप्त-प्रणीतत्वं न दुष्यति । 
विप्रलम्भादयो दोषा विद्यन्ते पुं-गिरां सदा ||१५||","15. The character of being produced hy unwise and untrustworthy persons cannot (at all) become (associated as) a blemish with the eternal Vedas. In regard to human utterances, (however), there may always be the faults of deceitfulness, etc., (in association with them)."

वेदस्य नित्यता प्रोक्ता प्रामाण्येनोपयुज्यते ||१९||","16-19. As (we hold that) the Vedas are not personal productions, we have no suspicion of any faultiness whatsoever (in relation to them). A few Naiyayikas and others, who believe in the authoritativeness (of the Vedas) on account of their having been given out by the Lord, take objection to the view that the Vedas do not possess the characteristics of personal productions, (and say) that the Vedas are to them of (divinely) personal origin, inasmuch as they possess the character of (being made up of) sentences like the Bharata and other such works, and that (nevertheless) the authoritativeness (of the Vedas) is also well established in that they have been produced by the Lord of all. In regard to (all) works of personal origin, it is right to ask whether or not there is authoritativeness (in them). There being no speaker in respect of the (original productive utterance of the) Vedas, even such a talk ( about authoritativeness) is impossible (in relation to them). The eternality which is predicated of the Vedas (by us) is (therefore) utilised to establish their authoritativeness."
"sarveśvara-praṇītatvaṁ prāmāṇyasyaiva kāraṇam | 
tad ayuktaṁ pramāṇena kenātreśvara-kalpanā ||20||","सर्वेश्वर-प्रणीतत्वं प्रामाण्यस्यैव कारणम् । 
तद् अयुक्तं प्रमाणेन केनात्रेश्वर-कल्पना ||२०||",20. (To hold) that the reason of the authoritativeness (of the Vedas) is (to be found) entirely in their being produced by the Lord of all -- that is not right. With the help of which criterion of truth is the Lord in this connection assumed to exist?
"sa yady āgama-kalpaḥ syān nityo'nityaḥ kim āgamaḥ | 
nityaś cet taṁ pratīśasya keyaṁ kartṛtva-kalpanā ||21||","स यद्य् आगम-कल्पः स्यान् नित्योऽनित्यः किम् आगमः ।

If it be eternal, then what is (the meaning of) this assumption of the agency of the Lord in regard to it (as a thing produced by  Him) ?"

स्वत एव प्रमाणत्वम् अतो वेदस्य सुस्थिरम् ||२३||","22-23 In regard to the view (that the scripture is) non­eternal, there will arise the fallacy of reciprocal dependence. That the authoritativeness of the scripture is due to its being the language of the Lord, and that the Lord is (in His turn) established by means of that same scripture, is accordingly the fallacy of reciprocal dependence (here). Therefore, it is well established that the Vedas are possessed of authoritativeness altogether in themselves."

It may, however, be objected (here) that, (even) without the Vedas, the yogins perceive directly and clearly (what is) dharma (or duty), in the manner of (other persons perceiving) the fruit of the emblic myrobalan when placed on the palm of the hand. How (then) can the Vedas be the sole source of authority (in relation to duty)? It is not right to say so (in objection); the yogin cannot be different in nature from such as are like ourselves."

Perception and what is called inference, and then comparison (or analogy), presumption from circumstances, and also the negative proof of non-perception, (these) do not indeed teach us duty. Perception, which gives rise to the knowledge of existing things by means of the contact of the several senses (with them), cannot surely apprehend that which has passed away or that which has not (yet) arrived. Owing to the non-existence of anything which has the character of being an invariable concomitant of dharma (or duty), inference also does not evidently give rise to the knowledge of duty and non-duty. As there is nothing (at all) anywhere which resembles duty, etc., comparison (or analogy), which (only) apprehends similarities, cannot be the means of making out duty and non-duty. 1f, by means of the evidence of circumstantial presumption, only a general proposition is arrived at to the effect that duty is the cause or pleasure and non-duty (the cause) of pain, there is nothing  wrong (in it). (But) a general rule cannot be put into practice. Moreover, (such a rule) may then be found to be too late (in coming, when duty has to be actually judged by its result)."

The (negative) proof of non-perception cannot throw light on merit (as associated with duty) and on demerit (as associated with non-duty}; because it is always in the absence of the (first) five means of knowledge that this (negative proof of non-perception) has scope to operate. Therefore, it is established that duty and non-duty fall exclusively within the scope (of the authority) of the Vedas."

The work which is enjoined exclusively by the Vedas yields the salvation of final deliverance; and none other than that (yields such deliverance). Therefore, one who is desirous of final deliverance, should not, in respect of this matter, be engaged (either) in those (activities) which have particular objects of desire in view or in those which are prohibited (by the Vedas)."

In regard to the Supreme Self taught in (the scriptural injunction) -- ""The Atman (or Self) should be known, etc."" -- the knowledge (of that Supreme Self) is certainly (capable of being) born in the individual selves. The atman (or the self) of him, who performs the works enjoined (in the scripture) and practises the yoga consisting of pratyahara and the other constituent elements, is (indeed) realised at last through direct perception (by him) with the aid of the (internal) organ of manas (or the faculty of attention) as the instrument. The atman is both differentiated and undifferentiated, and is like the (conception of the) ox, (for instance), both real and unreal. Although (the atman is) differentiated when in the form of individual souls, yet He is undifferentiated as the Supreme (Soul) -­ is unreal in the form of individual selves and real in the form of the Supreme (Self)."
